## Inspiration
Some members of our team had a very poor track record of finishing assignments on time, they always had a habit for cramming in to the last second. So we set out to fix that.
## What it does
Essentially, the tool allows users to split up larger tasks into a smart action plan. Once the user has decided on the subtasks of the overall task, the tool automatically schedules study/work sessions for them on their google calendar -taking into account their existing events- In addition to this, the tool also allocates times for the user in between work sessions for wellbeing.
## How we built it
We built our frontend through emberJS and semantic-ui. This connected to our backend API created with standard library (stdlib).
## Challenges we ran into
Ember cli proved to be more difficult than we anticipated when it came to integrating with stdlib.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We've managed to create a stable backend API as well as an algorithm for creating and sorting events using the Google Calendar API
## What we learned
We've gained a huge insight into full stack development, whereas when we started our team members mostly leaned to one side (frontend or backend)
## What's next for havealife
We had to cut down on a lot of functionality in order to make the deadline, mainly on the front-end web-app. In the future we'd like to see better Calendar API integrations, and a few fixes for some of the bugs we couldn't get to during the hackathon.
